## 2023-10-27 — [Tailwind Skip-Link Pattern]
**Learning:** When recreating WordPress skip-link accessibility patterns in this Tailwind CSS setup, avoid toggling `sr-only` with `focus:not-sr-only` due to positioning conflicts.
**Action:** Instead, explicitly handle positioning and visibility on focus (e.g., `absolute -translate-y-full focus:translate-y-0 -left-[9999px] focus:left-4 top-4 z-[100000]`). Ensure the target `<main>` tag has `tabIndex={-1}` and `outline: none` on focus to maintain functionality without visible focus rings.
